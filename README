This project allows to generate DSHOT protocol to control ESCs via the
GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi 5.  It uses 'piolib' and RP1 coprocessor
to generate the signal. It works well even if the main CPU is loaded
by other tasks.

It supports up to 26 motors. However, motors shall be connected to up
to 4 continuous ranges of GPIO numbers.

To compile and run a simple test that spins 4 motors connected to GPIO
16, 19, 20 and 21 (two continuos ranges of GPIOs) , type:

    	   make test
	   sudo ./test 16 19 20 21

If it does not work you may need to edit 'motor-dshot.c' and adjust
DSHOT_DIVIDER_FACTOR macro.

All versions of DSHOT (150 / 300 / 600 / 1200) are supported. The
specific version has to be set into 'dshotVersion' variable prior to
initialization.

You will need the newest version of Raspbian OS and the newest version
of EEPROM firmware (see the ‘Advanced Options’ section of
raspi-config) to run this code.
